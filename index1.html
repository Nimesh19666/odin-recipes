    <p>Paneer is a fresh, non-aged cheese that is made by curdling hot milk with a food acid like lemon juice or vinegar. The curdled and coagulated milk particles are collected in a muslin to drain the extra whey. Either the muslin bundle is kept under a heavy weighted object or it is hung over a hook or the kitchen sink faucet handle for the whey to be drained. for more info and recipes <a href="/Users/nimesh/repos/git_test/odin-recipes/recipes/paneer.html">INFO</a></p>
