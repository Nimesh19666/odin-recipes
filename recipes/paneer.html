    <h1>Paneer</h1>
    
    <p>Paneer is a fresh, non-aged cheese that is made by curdling hot milk with a food acid like lemon juice or vinegar. The curdled and coagulated milk particles are collected in a muslin to drain the extra whey. Either the muslin bundle is kept under a heavy weighted object or it is hung over a hook or the kitchen sink faucet handle for the whey to be drained.</p>
    <p>Once all the whey is drained what you get is a block of fresh cheese which you can cut into cubes. Paneer does not melt on cooking. Paneer is firm and can be cut into blocks or cubes or any shape that you prefer. It can also be grated, shredded or scrambled.
